# Symptom-Based Medical Recommendation
SymptomSync is a clinic-based project designed to provide personalized health advice based on user-reported symptoms. The application uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to suggest possible cures and medication dosages. This project leverages the Mimic-IV dataset for medical data and integrates a user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter.

# Features
Symptom Analysis: Enter symptoms to receive a potential conditions and suggested remedies.
Personalized Recommendations: Provides tailored medication suggestions and dosages based on the analyzed symptoms.
Intuitive GUI: Simple and interactive graphical user interface for seamless user experience.

# Technologies Used
Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
SpaCy: For natural language processing.
Scikit-Learn: For machine learning and similarity calculations.
TfidfVectorizer: For transforming text data into numerical features.
Cosine Similarity: For measuring the similarity between symptom descriptions and medical conditions.
Mimic-IV Dataset: Used as the medical dataset for this project.
